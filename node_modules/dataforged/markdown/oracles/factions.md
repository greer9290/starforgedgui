## Faction Projects

Pick or roll on this table to reveal the current focus of a faction. Then, use the nature of the organization to help envision the meaning of the project. The result may introduce events that motivate your character to aid or resist the project, or can serve as background detail for your setting. If you would like to track the faction’s progress, set a clock for the project using the campaign clock guidelines on page 235.

## Faction Relationships

Factions add scale and narrative opportunities to your setting. But keep it manageable. Don’t overload your campaign with factions. Instead, focus on your interactions and entanglements with members of a few interesting factions. Then, when you have a question about the relationship of one faction to another, use this table. The result is the commonly understood connection between those factions. Further investigations or events may reveal a deeper or alternate truth.

## Faction Name Template

To generate a faction name, first roll or choose the name template. Then, follow the structure of the template to build the name from individual tables. If you’ve already set the faction type, picking from the tables (instead of rolling) will likely provide a more appropriate result. For example, “Silver Jackals” is a fitting name for a criminal organization. The “Empire of the Undying Suns” is a less apt name for that gang—unless their leader is prone to delusions of grandeur. In short, choosing a name will give you more control. Rolling might give you a result that doesn’t square with known aspects, but those contradictions may prove inspiring.

An alternative approach to generating a faction from scratch is to start with a random name. Then, consider what the name evokes and choose an appropriate faction type instead of rolling on those tables. For example, “Bloody Ravens” might suggest a mercenary guild, while the “Republic of the Radiant Servants” brings to mind a dominion built upon a religion, or one that idolizes a prophesied leader. If a result doesn’t inspire anything interesting, roll again or pick.
